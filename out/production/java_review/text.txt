Interface
    Interface --> abstract type --> single specification for implement functionality
    enum implements Interface
    record implements Interface
    class implements Interface
    Interface extends "Another" Interface
    abstract implements Interface

    Summary: An abstract class provides common definition, as a base class, that multiple
    derived classes can share

        when to use?
    - share code among serveral closely related classes
    - expect classes to extends your abstract class to have common methods, fields, or access

    Summary: the Interface decouples the "what" from the "how", and is used
    to make different types behave in similar ways

        when to use?
    - you expect that unrelated classes will implement your interface
    - you want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned 
    about who implements its behavior

Generic
    Generic class 
        class Name<>{} --> using <T> any type allowed
        can include many types class Name<T, S, U, V...>{}
        bound class Name<T extends Interface/Class/Interface + Class/Multiple Interfaces>

Comparator --> interface use to make object comparable
    int compare(T o1, T o2) --> compare two same type with each other

Comparable --> interface use to make object comparable
    int comapreTo(T o) --> compare the arguments with the current instance

Generic methods
    public <T> String method(T input){}
    public <T extends ....> method(T input){} --> adding bound
    List<? extends ....> input --> ? is a wild card for type
    List<? super ...> input --> ? super here is lower bound

178 - nested classes, local types & annonymous classes

    Encapsulation and access rules
        private or public or protect
    local classes
        final 
    annonymous class --> local with no Name , nested inside other class

186 - Lambda Expressions

    similar to what we been using in javascript
    a functional interface is an interface that has one and only one, abstract method

    Lambda Expressions: is a funcitonal programming approach (modern way)
        just compute and return result (quick and easy)
    
    Consumer - Function - Predicate - Supplier
        consumer: void accept(T t) --> execute code without returning data
        function: R apply(T t) --> return result of an operation
        predicate: boolean test(T t) --> test if true or false
        supplier: T get() --> return an instance of something

207 - Hash

    Hash Collection 
        HashSet
        LinkedHashSet
        HashMap
        LinkedHashMap
    Set (unique, no duplicate)
        derive from object  
        access to equals or hashcode method override
        operation: union, intersection, difference

    Map another data structure in collection framework
        key value pairs
    EnumSet: set implementation for use with enum values
    EnumMap: map implementation for use with enum type keys

    Mutable: not remains constant
    Immutable: remains constant (has some side effects)
    Modifier:
        Final --> just like the word "FINAL"
            public final
            protected final
            private final 
            --overriding vs hiding
    Shallow copied: copy surface or structure not elements
    Deep copied: copy surface and strucutre and elements
    
    Unmodifiable Views: for view only -- cannot made changes
