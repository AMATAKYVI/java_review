Interface
    Interface --> abstract type --> single specification for implement functionality
    enum implements Interface
    record implements Interface
    class implements Interface
    Interface extends "Another" Interface
    abstract implements Interface

    Summary: An abstract class provides common definition, as a base class, that multiple
    derived classes can share

        when to use?
    - share code among serveral closely related classes
    - expect classes to extends your abstract class to have common methods, fields, or access

    Summary: the Interface decouples the "what" from the "how", and is used
    to make different types behave in similar ways

        when to use?
    - you expect that unrelated classes will implement your interface
    - you want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned 
    about who implements its behavior

Generic
    Generic class 
        class Name<>{} --> using <T> any type allowed
        can include many types class Name<T, S, U, V...>{}
        bound class Name<T extends Interface/Class/Interface + Class/Multiple Interfaces>

Comparator --> interface use to make object comparable
    int compare(T o1, T o2) --> compare two same type with each other

Comparable --> interface use to make object comparable
    int comapreTo(T o) --> compare the arguments with the current instance

Generic methods
    public <T> String method(T input){}
    public <T extends ....> method(T input){} --> adding bound
    List<? extends ....> input --> ? is a wild card for type
